Starcounter
===========

Starcounter [(www.starcounter.com)](http://www.starcounter.com) is a memory centric [database management system (DBMS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dbms) (a.k.a. RAM database) with a built in [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dbms) style server. It supports [SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dbms) queries and is fully [ACID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acid) compliant. Disks are used to secure the transaction log as well as a checkpointed database image.

Starcounter can be used to build modern applications such as web applications, mobile services and massive real time software such as games, advertising and telecom applications.
