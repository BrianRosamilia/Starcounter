Starcounter
===========

Starcounter is a memory centric [database management system (DBMS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dbms) with a built in [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dbms) style server. It supports [SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dbms) queries and is fully [ACID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acid) compliant and uses disk to secure the transaction log as well as a checkpointed database image. It can be used to build modern applications such as web applications, mobile services and massive real time software such as games, advertising and telecom applications.
